# SHA1-Bruteforcer
A simple program which will bruteforce a SHA1 hash. 

For ethical use only



# How to use? 

Edit the python file. 
There is a "mode" all modes are self explanitory however I shall go over it below
After choosing a 'mode' you put in the SHA-1 hash which you want to be bruteforced. 


# How fast is this?

The code itself is efficent and fast. However Python isn't 100% the best language for this. However this code is simple. 
This may be a bit faster in C or C++. 

using "all" mode will be very slow. Compared to "lowercase". Lowercase mode will ONLY try the lowercase alphabetical characters so hence the reason it'll be faster.
It's still quite slow though and I suggest using multithreading this or using a high performance PC which has loads of cores and RAM which will naturally make this faster. 

I also suggest freeing up on resouces when using this code to make sure it's 100% optimal in making progress


# Wordlists?

I do not plan on making a wordlist option as of yet. However you may use this code however you like and make it so this code allows wordlists 

# Modes

- "All" = All numbers, characters and symbols
- "Alphabetical" = Alphabetical. Uppercase and Lowercase
- "Numbers" = Numbers 1234567890
- "Basic Symbols" = symbols:  !$@*()
- "All Symbols" = All symbols
- "Only Lowercase" = only lowercase alphabetical letters
- "Only Uppercase" = only uppercase alphabetical letters

**all modes must be spelt correctly or else it wont work. It is CaSe SeNsItIvE**




# how to run? 

just run the .py python file after editing what you need 
I will NOT explain how to run a python file here. Ask someone else or go to chatGPT
